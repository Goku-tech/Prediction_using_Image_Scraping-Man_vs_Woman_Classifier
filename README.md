# Prediction_using_Image_Scraping-Man_vs_Woman_Classifier:

## In this project I have used bing image downloader to download 1000 images of men and women respectively to create a total of 2000 training set images.
## I have also created a validation set of 600 images with 300 images each of men and women.
## The ImageData Generator was used by me to develope the training and validation dataset from the downloaded images.
## Moreover,I have visualized the filters and filtermaps  of the convolutional and maxpooling layers  followed by evaluation and summary of the model.
